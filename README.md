# DroneFeatureSelection
Project Description: There are sensors spread throughout a field and in order to collect their data you must travel to them, so a drone is used. The amount of sensors the drone can visit is limited by the battery of the drone. Machine Learning models can be used to predict the values of the unvisited sensors from the values of the ones visited by the drone. Our goal is to maximize the accuracy of these predictions by selecting the best subset of features for the drone to travel to without exceeding the energy budget of the drone's battery.
